Assign Credential
=================

Since Blureprints are exported as clear text, they do not retain credential information that could potentially be used maliciously.  You'll be required to set the **Credentials**.

Configure Blueprint Variables
=============================

The following Blueprint variables should be configured before use: 

On the SQL Service, set the variable "install_location" to external to download ISO from internet, or internal to download from a file share. If set to external, no further variables need to be modified.

If set to internal, you will need to fill out the following variables:

- install_location     internal
- file_share_user      administrator
- file_share_password  nutanix/4u
- file_server_ip       10.21.66.59
- file_share_name      sql
- sql_iso_path (include path and iso file)  SQLServer2014!
- mapped_drive         z


Enable CredSSP
==============
To Enable CredSSP on the Karan host, please follow steps below:

1. On the Karan Host run the following command to enable CredSSP as a client role and allow Karan host to Delegate credentials to all computers ( Wild card mask "*")
 Enable-WSManCredSSP -Role Client -DelegateComputer *
2. From command prompt window run “gpedit.msc”
3. In the group policy editor window Goto Computer-configuration -> administrative templates -> system ->credential delegation
4. Double click on “Allow Delgating Fresh Credentials with NTLM-only server authentication”
5. Select Enable radio button
6. Click on the show button
7. In the value field add  “WSMAN/*”. This allows delegate fresh credentials to WSMAN running in any remote computer
